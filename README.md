# PocketHorseTrainer
A cross-platform mobile application to help equestrians train virtually.
### Overview
This app was designed by an equestrian, for equestrians. My trainer developed her own technique, and has clients all over the world, but has trouble training those clients through the technology available. 
The goal of this app is facilitate those relationships by providing an interface that lets owners track their horse's training sessions, track their own training goals, and receive feedback from their connected trainer.
